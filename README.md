# csNMEA
This is a very simplistic implementation of b3nn0's EU Stratux gps.go ublox NMEA sentence configuration, ultimately processed through 101100's nmea-simple codecs, with the addition of json output. Both the go and js codes have been ported to C#, using the linux versions of the .NET Core SDK and vscode running on on Ubuntu MATE 20.04.
